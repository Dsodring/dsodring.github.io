					<h1>UX Design - Web Evaluation</h1>

					<h2>Purpose of This Project</h2>

					<p>
						This project was part of my final year at Manchester Metropolitan University. The outcome of this project was a web evaluation video of a Manchester student accommodation website.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this project, a variety of usability testing methods, techniques and tools were used. The various tests were carried out in a team of 5, all working on an evaluation on the same student accommodation website. However, once the tests were completed, each individual was required to draw their own conclusions and design their own solutions, based on the data gathered from the tests.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Objective & Approach
					</h2>

					<p>
						The objective of this report was to familiarise students with a variety of usability testing methodologies, the result of this report was a video, outlining the methods and what the results were and our own solutions to the problems we discovered.
					</p>

					<p>
						This project was divided into four tasks:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li class="ux-process">Task 1 - Expert review</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Cognitive walkthrough</li>
							<li>Heuristic evaluation</li>
						</ul>
						<li class="ux-process">Task 2 - Guerilla testing</li>
						<li class="ux-process">Task 3 - A/B testing</li>
						<li class="ux-process">Task 4 - Individual solution and summary</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>
						Project Duration
					</h2>

					<p>
						January 17th, 2020 - May 1st, 2020
					</p>

					<h2>
						My Role
					</h2>

					<p>
						In the early phases of this project that involved teamwork, I was in charge of conducting the guerilla testing and making the designs for the A/B testing. The expert review was completed individually and the findings were then discussed within the team afterwards.
