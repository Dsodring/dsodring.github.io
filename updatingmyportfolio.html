				<h2>Changes To My Portfolio</h2>
				<p>
					A whole new colour scheme was chosen for the website, as the
					red and blue background felt a bit intense when reading long
					blog posts. The colour scheme now consists of an earthy
					background with headers in red, to create a slightly
					dramatic effect and this colour scheme also fits in well in
					scandiavian design and architecture.
				</p>
				<p>
					The project page was also completely redesigned and now has
					a similar look to the blog page, with the ‘broken grid’
					feel.
				</p>
				<p>
					The contact page also had some subtle design changes, such
					as using sharp borders and a shadow on the send my message
					button to fit in with the rest of the site.

				<h2>Changes Made Based On Feedback</h2>
				<p>
					During the portfolio showcase event, we had the opportunity
					to get valuable feedback from people working in the
					industry. As a result, I decided to make my portfolio more
					focused on web development, as that is the industry I wish
					to work in, and when talking to
					<a href="https://twitter.com/adam_bee">Adam Bee</a> from
					Dept, a common thing he noticed in students is that they are
					trying to be the ‘jack of all trades’, ending up with little
					knowledge in many different fields, instead of developing a
					passion for one or two subjects and specialising in them.
					The landing page of my portfolio has been redesigned
					slightly to align more with my passion for front end
					development and the image has been made square to better fit
					in with the rest of the website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other feedback included swapping the menu and title in the
					nav, as traditionally the nav is on the right side and the
					logo is on the right.
				</p>
				<p>
					The folder structure of my portfolio was also cleaned up and
					organised, the JavaScript files have been put in a separate
					folder and the images are sorted in different folders for
					easy access, the blog post HTML files was initially put in a
					folder by themselves in an effort to clean up the root
					folder, however, due to a limitation with GSAP, all HTML
					files are now placed on the root.
				</p>
				<p>
					When changing the colour scheme, a number of different fonts
					were also tried out, Open Sans is still used as the font for
					body text, and both Montserrat and Bebas Neue was tested as
					header fonts, but based on the feedback gathered, it was
					decided to stay with Montserrat.
				</p>
				<p>
					The page for individual projects have also been redesigned
					to have a similar look to the blog posts and more content
					has been added, such as images. The projects displayed on
					the project page have also been updated with newer projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Swup has also been replaced, and GSAP is now used to handle
					the animations for the content and page transitions,
					resulting in smoother and more customisable animations.
