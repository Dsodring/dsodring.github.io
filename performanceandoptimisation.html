				<h1>Performance And Optimisation</h1>

				<p class="author">By Daniel Sødring on October 10, 2019</p>

				<h2>Code</h2>

				<p>
					By using CSS grid, flexbox I have been able to design and
					layout my content with minimal code, compared to the
					out-dated techniques with floats which also required a lot
					of padding and margins to make the layout work. Flexbox only
					works for one-dimensional layouts so I have used that to
					style my overall page layout as it flows down the screen
					with very few lines of code, similarly for grid, which I
					have used for individual sections to achieve a 'broken grid'
					layout, because it works for two-dimensional layouts.
				</p>

				<p>
					To further reduce the lines of code needed in my CSS I have
					used global styling and resets on my headers, paragraphs,
					figures and lists so it applies across all my pages and I do
					not have to apply a font family or adjust margins
					individually on each page. I have also reviewed my CSS
					several times to try and limit the amount of unused CSS.
				</p>

				<p>
					As I have also used a
					<a href="https://swup.js.org/">JavaScript library</a>
					for my page transitions I made sure to use their minified
					version to save space as well as ‘defer’ them so they as the
					last thing, because the JavaScript code is only used for
					animating content when clicking on internal links.
				</p>

				<h2>Optimisation</h2>

				<p>
					No matter the size of any given website, images will be
					responsible for the majority of web content (<a
						href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/"
						>Everts, 2019</a
					>), so it was the highest priority for me to make sure they
					were optimised for a smooth experience when browsing my
					portfolio. To ensure that I optimised all images by reducing
					their size and applying compression to them. I did this with
					the website <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> which
					at the same time allowed me to convert the images into JPEG
					as that format is better and more optimised for the web.
				</p>

				<p>
					Importing and using custom fonts also takes up a significant
					amount of space. I only used two fonts and two font weights
					to make sure my custom fonts would not slow down the loading
					times of my website.
				</p>

				<h2>SEO Integration</h2>

				<p>
					I made sure to include both meta keywords, custom meta
					descriptions to show what is on my subpages and custom
					titles on all my pages for SEO purposes. For my anchor text
					I avoided using words such as ‘click here’ or ‘read more’ as
					they do not explain what the link does and is therefore not
					SEO friendly.
				</p>

				<p>
					Using semantic HTML to indicate a clear page structure with
					header, main and footer along with nav, h1, h2, h3, p and
					figures also allows search engines to easily understand and
					sort the content of my portfolio, so I made sure to have a
					clear structure and limit the use of div tags throughout my
					HTML. By including alt text on all my images it tells the
					search engine what that image is and makes it easier to
					understand, plus including alt text is also very important
					for accessibility in regards to screen readers. To further
					increase accessibility I also decided to include a ‘skip to
					content’ link at the very top of all pages that is only
					shown when focused with a keyboard.
