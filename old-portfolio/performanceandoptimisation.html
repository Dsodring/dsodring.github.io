					<h1>
						Performance And Optimisation
					</h1>

					<div class="blog-details">
						<p>10th October, 2019</p>
						<p>Daniel Sødring</p>
					</div>

					<h1>
						Code
					</h1>

					<p>
						By using CSS grid, flexbox I have been able to design
						and layout my content with minimal code, compared to the
						out-dated techniques with floats which also required a
						lot of padding and margins to make the layout work.
						Flexbox only works for one-dimensional layouts so I have
						used that to style my overall page layout as it flows
						down the screen with very few lines of code, similarly
						for grid, which I have used for individual sections to
						achieve a 'broken grid' layout, because it works for
						two-dimensional layouts.
					</p>

					<p>
						To further reduce the lines of code needed in my CSS I
						have used global styling and resets on my headers,
						paragraphs, figures and lists so it applies across all
						my pages and I do not have to apply a font family or
						adjust margins individually on each page. I have also
						reviewed my CSS several times to try and limit the
						amount of unused CSS.
					</p>

					<p>
						As I have also used a
						<a href="https://swup.js.org/">JavaScript library</a>
						for my page transitions I made sure to use their
						minified version to save space as well as ‘defer’ them
						so they as the last thing, because the JavaScript code
						is only used for animating content when clicking on
						internal links.
					</p>

					<h1>
						Optimisation
					</h1>

					<p>
						No matter the size of any given website, images will be
						responsible for the majority of web content (<a
							href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/"
							>Everts, 2019</a
						>), so it was the highest priority for me to make sure
						they were optimised for a smooth experience when
						browsing my portfolio. To ensure that I optimised all
						images by reducing their size and applying compression
						to them. I did this with the website
						<a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> which at the
						same time allowed me to convert the images into JPEG as
						that format is better and more optimised for the web.
					</p>

					<p>
						Importing and using custom fonts also takes up a
						significant amount of space. I only used two fonts and
						two font weights to make sure my custom fonts would not
						slow down the loading times of my website.
					</p>

					<h1>
						SEO Integration
					</h1>

					<p>
						I made sure to include both meta keywords, custom meta
						descriptions to show what is on my subpages and custom
						titles on all my pages for SEO purposes. For my anchor
						text I avoided using words such as ‘click here’ or ‘read
						more’ as they do not explain what the link does and is
						therefore not SEO friendly.
					</p>

					<p>
						Using semantic HTML to indicate a clear page structure
						with header, main and footer along with nav, h1, h2, h3,
						p and figures also allows search engines to easily
						understand and sort the content of my portfolio, so I
						made sure to have a clear structure and limit the use of
						div tags throughout my HTML. By including alt text on
						all my images it tells the search engine what that image
						is and makes it easier to understand, plus including alt
						text is also very important for accessibility in regards
						to screen readers. To further increase accessibility I
						also decided to include a ‘skip to content’ link at the
						very top of all pages that is only shown when focused
						with a keyboard.
