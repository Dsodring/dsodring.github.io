						Building My Portolio
					</h1>

					<div class="blog-details">
						<p>7th October, 2019</p>
						<p>Daniel Sødring</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						Here I go into more detail about how I have built my
						portfolio, what technologies and methods I have used
						have used and any design decisions I have made.
					</p>

					<h2>Design</h2>

					<p>
						Before designing my portfolio I browsed through
						<a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> for
						inspiration and to see what is new and trending in web
						design. A thing I took note of was the use of bright
						colours and vivid drawings in website design. I decided
						to go with a slightly toned down colour palette. Using
						pastel colours throughout my website to achieve a warmer
						and friendlier look, while still maintaining a
						professional appearance with the fonts Montserrat for
						headers and Open Sans for body text.
					</p>

					<p>
						I found an
						<a
							href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-broken-grid-layout-using-css-grid--cms-30870"
							>article</a
						>, talking about a ‘broken’ grid layout with CSS Grid. I
						Tried to replicate a similar look in my mobile and
						desktop layout of my portfolio.
					</p>

					</figure>

					<p>
						For my landing page I wanted to keep it simple and
						without a lot of text. The goal was for visitors to
						easily identify and understand who I am and what I do.
					</p>

					<p>
						Designing my blog page I wanted to use larger pictures
						to catch the eye follow by the title and a short
						description of the blog posts content. I initially had
						the idea of a side navigation for all my blog posts but
						when coding my website I realised the three blog posts
						did not take up a lot of space so I decided not to use
						the menu and only implement it if more blog posts are
						added in the future.
					</p>

					<p>
						For my project page I wanted to keep it even more simple
						and clean by only using a large image with the project
						title, hoping the image or graphic will intrigue the
						user to investigate and enter the subpage to read more
						about the project.
					</p>

					<p>
						I kept the contact page light and simple with a HTML
						contact form from
						<a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree.io</a>, coded
						by
						<a href="https://twitter.com/wilsond">Derren Wilson</a>
						and changed the style to fit the overall look of my
						website. Initially my HTML consisted of the input name
						and a bottom border, but in a study done by Google’s
						Material Design on text fields, they concluded text
						fields should either include a semi-transparent fill
						with a bottom border or a stroke and rounded corners,
						among other key findings (<a
							href="https://medium.com/google-design/the-evolution-of-material-designs-text-fields-603688b3fe03"
							>Zarasky et al., 2019</a
						>), so I later changed it to conform to their findings.
					</p>

					<h2>Build</h2>

					<p>
						I started building my website in VS Code with a mobile
						first approach without the use CSS
						<a
							href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
							>flexbox</a
						>
						or
						<a
							href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"
							>grid</a
						>, as without it, the page is already fully responsive
						and fits a mobile screen really well with minimal
						styling. I initially had my navigation at the top like
						on desktop websites, but in a talk on
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfn_tVY5qRI"
							>Designing for Speed & Hacking User Perception</a
						>, Mustafa Kurtuldu talks about different styles of
						navigation including hamburger menu, backdrop drawer and
						top taps. In his talk he outlines how Facebook
						successfully implemented a bottom navigation and saw an
						increase in perception of speed, satisfaction and
						engagement (<a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfn_tVY5qRI"
							>Conversions, 2019</a
						>), and it obviously makes sense to put the navigation
						on the bottom on smaller devices such as smartphones as
						we can only move our thumbs so far up the screen
						<a
							href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/"
							>before it gets uncomfortable</a
						>.
					</p>

							alt="mobile contact page of my portfolio"
						/>
					</figure>

					<p>
						I used flexbox and grid to design my layout on screens
						with a width larger than 900px by using media queries
						and by using a nested grid layout I could replicate the
						‘broken grid layout’. I decided to only have the H1 and
						links break the grid as it would otherwise seem too
						cluttered and the smaller text would be difficult to
						read as it would be overlapping with images.
					</p>

					<p>
						Before deciding on a final colour scheme I ran tests
						with the
						<a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"
							>WebAIM Contrast Checker</a
						>, I initially passed the AA check on small text with
						the original pastel red background and lighter grey
						paragraph, but after changing the paragraph colour to
						#222 it passed with the WCAG AAA.
					</p>

					<p>
						I used <a href="https://swup.js.org/">Swup</a> which is
						a JavaScript library to animate my page transitions. I
						decided to use page transitions because they are not
						only aesthetically pleasing but they also provide visual
						continuity and positive feedback (<a
							href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/improving-user-flow-through-page-transitions/"
							>De Rosa, 2016</a
						>). One of my concerns when including the Swup.JS
						library was speed, but in a test done on Firefox, the
						two script files were only 5.35KB and 419 B in size so
						it did not have any noticeable impact on the loading
						times.
					</p>

					<h2>Launch</h2>

					<p>
						I have all my files and images saved in my
						<a href="https://github.com/Dsodring/portfolio"
							>GitHub repository</a
						>
						to make sure they are kept safe and I can edit them both
						at home and university. For hosting my website I have it
						on
						<a href="https://danielsodring.com"
							>danielsodring.com</a
						>
						and <a href="https://www.34sp.com/">34SP.com</a> under
						the domain
