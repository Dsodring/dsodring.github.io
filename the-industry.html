				<h1>The Industry</h1>

				<p class="author">By Daniel Sødring on November 6, 2019</p>

				<p>
					Demand for developer and UX roles are growing despite
					Brexit, so it is still a good time to break into the
					industry, but as students we still need to put in a lot of
					work outside of class as shown in a
					<a
						href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019"
						>Manchester Digital Skills Audit for 2019</a
					>, the current curriculum is not up to date according to the
					industry.
				</p>

				<p>
					In a survey done by
					<a
						href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019"
						>Manchester Digital</a
					>, 56% of businesses reported an increase of staffing levels
					and only 11% experienced a decline and the same businesses
					also reported that the roles with the most growth were
					developers, digital marketing and user experience. Web
					development and user experience are also the fields I am
					most interested and currently spend a lot of my spare time
					developing my skills in and plan on pursuing a career in
					after university.
				</p>

				<h2>What does it take to get a job?</h2>

				<p>
					Developer, AI, machine learning and user experience are the
					three fields most likely to grow. Although 74% of businesses
					recruit graduates, only 29% of them have an in-house scheme,
					making it more difficult to break into the industry
					successfully. One thing that will help, is having a well
					designed portfolio and the most common complaint was the
					recruitment process being too labour intensive and finding
					the right candidates was difficult (<a
						href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019"
						>Manchester Digital, 2019</a
					>). In a podcast with two Google employee’s (<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsHNxOcOJTw"
						>The Futur, 2019</a
					>),
					<a href="https://twitter.com/mustafa_x?lang=da"
						>Mustafa Kurtuldu, UX lead and Design Advocate at
						Google</a
					>, outlines what a good UX portfolio should include and they
					discuss how recruiting for a UX role and having to go
					through their portfolio can be very time consuming, which
					supports the results from the Manchester Digital report for
					that field. That shows the importance of having a good and
					well designed portfolio to showcase your work and the
					process you have gone through for your products and
					projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					60% of businesses responding to the survey by
					<a
						href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019"
						>Manchester Digital</a
					>, thought the current curriculum was not up to date. In the
					podcast by
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsHNxOcOJTw"
						>The Futur</a
					>, they talk about design trends in 2019 and the Google
					employee’s mention they have been pushing mobile and a
					mobile-first approach for a long time now. But in order to
					develop mobile-first, you need to have a good understanding
					of CSS, more specifically
					<a
						href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"
						>CSS grid</a
					>
					and
					<a
						href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
						>flex</a
					>, which we are learning.
				</p>

				<p>
					I was talking to a friend who is a student at Manchester
					Metropolitan University, he told me they had coursework due
					and the requirements were to build a website with some
					simple content in it, we got talking about layouts using CSS
					and I mentioned grid and flex and he had no idea how to use
					those techniques. So there is definitely a gap somewhere,
					and as a student trying to break into the industry after
					graduation it is necessary to learn and do research outside
					your course to fully understand the industry trends and best
					practices.
				</p>

				<h2>What does Brexit mean for the tech industry?</h2>

				<p>
					A key point to touch on is Brexit and the uncertain
					circumstances around it. As an EU student it will certainly
					have an impact on my future and I am not sure if I will be
					staying in the UK to pursue a career or move back to Denmark
					or another country in Europe and try my luck there. In fact,
					Denmark is among the best to grow, attract and retain talent
					(<a
						href="https://investindk.com/insights/denmark-is-among-the-best-to-grow-attract-and-retain-talent"
						>Ministry of Foregin Affairs of Denmark, 2019</a
					>) with Denmark taking the number three spot on the
					<a href="https://gtcistudy.com/the-gtci-index/"
						>Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI)</a
					>
					in Europe, with the UK shortly after at 9th place. However
					when
					<a href="https://gtcistudy.com/special-section-gctci/"
						>comparing cities</a
					>, Copenhagen takes the top spot in the EU for its ability
					to compete for talents and is second in the world, only
					behind Washington DC.
				</p>

				<p>
					The consequences of Brexit are noticeable, 37% of businesses
					reported a negative impact from the uncertainty surrounding
					Brexit and said it is more difficult to recruit from the EU
					(<a
						href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019"
						>Manchester Digital, 2019</a
					>). Similarly, according to a
					<a
						href="https://www.techuk.org/insights/reports/item/16122-techuk-report-tech-smes-and-no-deal-brexit"
						>techUK report</a
					>, between 65% and 77% of SMEs believe Brexit will have a
					fairly or very negative impact on their business, stating
					the main reason for this negative impact being lack of
					domestic talent due to high competition and difficulty
					recruiting talent from the EU or outside the EU due to the
					concerns surrounding a no deal Brexit.
				</p>

				<p>
					SMEs also reported they were unable to properly prepare for
					Brexit due to the unpredictability of a no deal agreement.
					However despite the disappointing news, the UK tech industry
					is still growing fast and steadily, with a 61% growth in
					investment for UK scaleup tech firms between 2017 and 2018
					(<a href="https://technation.io/report2019/"
						>Tech Nation, 2019</a
					>).
